# Nostrb

This is a simple, minimal library written Ruby for working with
[Nostr Events](https://nostr.com/the-protocol/events),
which are like Tweets but are used with the
[Nostr protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostr).
Events are cryptographically signed and verified with
[Schnorr Signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature), per
[NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/01.md)
(Nostr Improvement Protocol).
